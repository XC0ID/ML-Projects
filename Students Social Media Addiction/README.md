# 📱 Students Social Media Addiction - Machine Learning Project

This project analyzes how social media usage affects students and predicts addiction levels using machine learning techniques.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

Social media usage among students has increased rapidly and may affect academic performance, sleep patterns, and mental health.

Machine learning models can analyze usage data and identify addiction risk patterns.

Datasets studying students often include hundreds of responses and features related to usage habits and lifestyle. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
