# 👨‍💻 Nursery Admission Prediction – Machine Learning Project

A Machine Learning project that predicts nursery school admission decisions based on family, financial, and social conditions using classification algorithms.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

This project uses the **Nursery Dataset** to build machine learning models that classify nursery school applications into different recommendation categories.

The dataset was originally created to evaluate and rank nursery school applicants when demand exceeded available seats.

The goal of this project is to:

- Perform data preprocessing
- Train multiple ML classification models
- Evaluate performance
- Compare algorithms
- Identify the best-performing model
