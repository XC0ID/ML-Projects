# 🏦 Bank Machine Learning Project

This project is part of the **ML-Projects repository** and focuses on applying Machine Learning techniques to banking data. The objective is to analyze customer information and build predictive models that assist financial institutions in decision-making.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

Banks generate a large amount of data related to customers, transactions, and financial behavior. Machine Learning can be used to analyze this data and predict outcomes such as:

• Loan approval  
• Customer risk assessment  
• Default prediction  
• Customer segmentation  

This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
