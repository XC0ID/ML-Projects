# Disease

## Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds and compares multiple Machine Learning models to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on medical attributes.

### Dataset
- Name: Heart Disease Statlog Dataset
- File: `Heart_disease_statlog.csv`
- Target: Presence of heart disease (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

### Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost 

### Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebook

### Steps Performed
1. Data Loading
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Scaling
4. Train-Test Split
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Performance Comparison

#### Output

Each model is evaluated using:
Accuracy,
Precision,
Recall,
F1-score
