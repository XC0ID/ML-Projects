# 🩺 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning project that predicts possible diseases based on symptoms or medical features using classification algorithms. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how ML can assist in early diagnosis and healthcare analytics.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

Healthcare datasets contain valuable patterns that can be used to predict diseases early. In this project, we build a machine learning pipeline that:

- Processes medical or symptom data
- Trains predictive models
- Evaluates model performance
- Predicts diseases based on input features

This project is part of the **ML-Projects portfolio repository**.

# 🎯 Objectives

- Apply machine learning techniques to healthcare data
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Train and compare multiple ML models
- Evaluate performance using metrics
- Build a reproducible ML workflow
